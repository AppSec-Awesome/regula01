## v0.9.0 (2021-05-27)

### Added
* A `regula` CLI tool with lots of new features, including:
  * Support for HCL source code
  * Built-in OPA and input processing - removes the need for a separate OPA
    installation as well as the Python and Terraform dependencies.
  * Discovery of IaC configurations
  * Additional output formats (an ASCII table, JUnit XML, etc.)
  * A configurable exit status based on rule severity 
  * `test` and `repl` commands which enhance OPA with the Regula library

  For descriptions of the new features and how to use them, please see our updated
  documentation at https://regula.dev


### Changed
* Put all rego code in a `rego` subdirectory. Please see our Conftest documentation for the updated URLs.
