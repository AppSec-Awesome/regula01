## v1.3.0 (2021-09-02)

### Added
* Integration with Fugue's SaaS product via `regula scan`. This is a _purely optional_ feature and `regula run` continues to operate entirely standalone. Let us know if you'd like access to the closed beta by emailing support@fugue.co!

### Removed
* Out-of-date NIST mappings (#175)

### Fixed
* Errors from some Terraform configurations that use variables with nested complex types (#176)
* Bug where .terraform directory can get loaded when --no-ignore option is used (#181)
* Use consistent evaluation order for local variables in Terraform (#184)
